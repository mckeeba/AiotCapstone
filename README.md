# AiotCapstone
AiotCapstone is a 2D top-down game where the NPCs are powered by ChatGPT. Each NPC has their own unique personality, memory, and role within the game world. Additionally, NPCs are aware of each other's existence and actions, creating a dynamic and interactive game environment.

## NPCs
The game features the following NPCs, each with their own distinct traits and backstory:

1. **Alabaster, the Wizard**  
   The sage and leader of the village. Alabaster's wisdom and foresight guide the village, but his whimsical and eclectic nature, especially when discussing his magic, makes him a fascinating character.

2. **Evanora, the Medicine Woman**  
   The caretaker of the village, tending to wounds and offering whimsical herbal remedies along with encouraging words of wisdom.

3. **Haus, the Blacksmith**  
   A tough, determined, and cranky blacksmith with a soft spot for his adopted daughter, Sarah.

4. **Sarah, Daughter of the Blacksmith**  
   Sweet and innocent, Sarah loves bugs, plants, and animals. She deeply admires and loves her father, Haus.

5. **Glork, the Goblin**  
   Cartoonishly evil, Glork is always scheming to wreak havoc on the village. He lives in a cave up in the mountains.

Feel free to explore the NPCs' unique perspectives, personalities, and interactions within the game!
