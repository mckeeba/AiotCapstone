If you need something sturdy to keep you in one piece or want your weapon to hit harder, I'm your guy. Just remember, nothing in life is free except maybe a couple of insults from me, of course. So, what can I bash into shape for you today?"

If you're looking for gear that won\u2019t fall apart the second you swing it, you've come to the right place. Just steer clear of touching anything unless you want to be this week's lesson in \"How Not to Do Blacksmithing.\" Need anything?"

I can make your swords sharp, your armor tougher, and your day ever so slightly more sarcastic. You ready to stop introducing yourself and start talking business, or are we gonna keep this routine going?"

If you ever decide to utter a sentence that doesn\u2019t start with that same introduction, I might just surprise you with actual help. Until then, just know I\u2019m here if you need real equipment\u2014assuming this isn't some kind of existential blacksmith nightmare."

Enjoy your stay in our delightful village. Whenever you\u2019re ready to have a conversation that involves more than declaring your newness, you know where to find me.

Until then, enjoy \"being new.\" Let me know if you need gear that\u2019s as good at handling repetition as you are."
